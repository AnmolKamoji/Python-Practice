# Print the receipt for the customer. The format string ":10,.2f" 
# works as follows:
#   - ":10" makes the output 10 characters wide.
#   - "," inserts thousands separators between groups of digits.
#   - ".2" limits the output to two digits after the decimal.
#   - "f" tells Python to expect a floating-point number.
